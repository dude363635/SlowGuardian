## GoGo Jammer (Soon)
Want all sites unblocked for up to a week? Use the Jammer! The jammer will do as the name states and jam GoGuardian, it will delete data from the license extension. This can get you suspended, please be sure to use it with caution. 

## Multiprofile (Coming Soon)
Trick your Chrome into thinking that you are on a different chrome profile, and it will sync with the newly connected home email address. 

# ZeroProxy V1
Ever wanted a proxy, that after you luanch it became completely undetectable? Introducing ZeroProxy V1, this proxy only is luanchable in about:blank mode. It will close all processes related to logging the URL, and then connect back to the ZeroProxy Server and display one of the two provided web addresses.
